## Title
Data Rescue: Data, Metadata, and Futureproofing for the Next Data Disaster

1. Background
Image of news story - beyond the tech utopian rhetoric here, what's happening? How did this happen?

2. Today's broken data infrastructure
  - Lots of data is open
    - Government data, research data, agencies
  - In USA, there are atleast 800 data-releasing entities
    - Where does open data live? 
      - where ever the data creators or maintainers want to put it - no standards
      - Agency, insttution, repositories, publishers, the internet archive
    - How do you find it?
      - Data.gov
      - Agency, insttution, repositories
      - again, no standard
    - Is it mirrored or backed up?
       - Sometimes!
       
 3. So, what do you think happens when an agency website goes offline, or pages within an agency website are removed, or links break, or a server crashes?
    
4. DATA DISASTER
    
5. Now, this is a good time to remind you, that Science is Political. Rather than making my own slide, I like to use this picture of Amy Wibowo giving a talk. She draws cartoons that decolonialize the history of science and teach computer science. Science has always been political. Today is no different.
    
6. Politically sensitive topics, like climate change, are not getting the same funding, attnetion, and web presense now.
    And because we have no standardized systme of cataloging data, data has already been lost. 
    
    So that's the WHY. 
    
7. WHO- 
    Overview of players in the field:
    Data Rescue - distributed movements acorss the country to back up and document data
    DataRefuge - Archivers.Space queue, which I will work from today - they've got big plans!
    Climate mirror
    Azimuth
    Internet archive - crawls site that people nominate
    
8. Data needs to be backed up, mirrored, and documented with standardized, machine-readble metadata
  - These communities scientists, librarians, and software developers are comming together today in an unprecidented movement!
  - Each community has much to learn from the others - scientists know that metadata is important, but we don't have a unified standard
  - Librarians know metadata, but they're not the users of the data
  - IA and developers know how to build infrastructure and make things discoverable
 
  
9. With standarzided, machine readable metadata we can answer key questions
  - How much data exisits?
  - Where is is stored?
  - who is maintaining the datasets?
  - Which agencies are producing the datasets that get the most use?
  - And more!
  
 10. Together we can solve this 
  - and create new standards to prevent digital disaster
